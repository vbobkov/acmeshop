Forum Rules

) Thou shalt not spam or self-promote.
Irrelevant, advertising-focused and/or bot-generated content will be promptly deleted.

) Thou shalt not shill.
A definition of shill can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shill. This includes people who omit an association with a product or service for other reasons (they are paid to post about it, they are helping a friend, etc.) so that they can help promote it.

) Thou shalt not discuss illegal or questionable things.
We are a legitimate business and do not promote content such as links to (or discussion of) illegal/copyrighted downloads, hacks or other questionable content.

) Thou shalt not partake in trolling, personal attacks or use of inappropriate material.
Examples include insulting someone because of their beliefs, profanity, disturbing/NSFW material, etc, etc.

) Thou shalt not cross-post.
Creating identical or very similar posts across multiple sections of the forum is not allowed.

) Thou shalt not use multiple accounts.
If you are one person, then you need exactly ONE account to use these forums.  Any more is not allowed. And yes, we WILL find out!

) Thou shalt use the English language.
All publicly displayed messages are limited to the English language. Yes, alphabets such as Katakana (Japanese) and Cyrillic (Slavic) look really, really cool. No, they are still not allowed on this forum. This includes posts, titles, signatures, and any attachments or other forms of public display.

) Thou shalt consult each section's guidelines.
Each section has its own guidelines, stickied at the top.  It is generally a good idea to heed their advice.

We do our best to maintain a professional/family atmosphere, so that this can be a place anyone can come to for help or information.
Breaking these rules may result in immediate post deletion and an account suspension/ban.
